# Agent Safety

## Overview

Agent safety ensures that autonomous AI systems operate within defined boundaries and don't cause unintended harm.

## Threat Model

| Risk | Example | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| Unbounded tool use | Agent deletes files it shouldn't | File-level permissions, allowlists |
| Infinite loops | Agent gets stuck in retry cycle | Step budget, timeout |
| Data exfiltration | Agent sends secrets to external APIs | Output filtering, DLP |
| Prompt injection | Malicious input hijacks agent behavior | Input sanitization, sandboxing |
| Hallucinated actions | Agent calls wrong tool with wrong args | Schema validation, pre-flight checks |

## Defense Layers

1. **Input validation** — Sanitize user inputs before agent sees them
2. **Tool guards** — Permission checks on every tool call
3. **Step limits** — Max iterations per task
4. **Output filtering** — Review agent outputs before delivery
5. **Audit logging** — Every action is recorded

## Production Rules

- Never let agents execute destructive commands without confirmation
- Always sandbox file system access
- Rate limit API calls
- Log every tool call with arguments and results
